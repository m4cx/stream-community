# Chat Bot

At the current stage of development the chat bot is in general the way of a stream's typical user or viewer to interact with Stream Community. 
Here we will give a short overview of the available commands and their function.

## Commands
|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`!help` | This command gives a short overview of the current available commands in the connected chat.|
|`!enlist` | With this command you as a viewer of a stream can enlist into a viewer game with the streamer.|
|`!withdraw` | If you are still waiting for getting accepted but you don't want to wait any longer, you can withdraw your request with this command.|
